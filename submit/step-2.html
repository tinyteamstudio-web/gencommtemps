<h1>Step 2 · People & Relationships</h1>

<p class="lead">
  This step helps us understand <strong>who is part of your family or group</strong>
  and how people are related to each other.
</p>

<div class="soft-box">
  <h2>Important reminder</h2>
  <p>
    You do <strong>not</strong> need to list everyone at once.
    You may start with just a few people.
  </p>
  <p class="mini-note">
    It is okay if dates, spellings, or details are incomplete.
    This can be updated later.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="soft-box">
  <h2>How many people are included? (estimate)</h2>
  <p>
    You may simply choose one:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>1–10 people</li>
    <li>11–30 people</li>
    <li>31–100 people</li>
    <li>More than 100</li>
    <li>Not sure yet</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="soft-box">
  <h2>Prepare a simple list of people</h2>
  <p>
    For each person, please prepare the following information:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Full name</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Relationship</strong><br />
      (example: father, mother, child, spouse, sibling, member)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Status</strong><br />
      Living · Deceased · Prefer not to say
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mini-note">
    Dates of birth or death are <strong>not required</strong> at this stage.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="soft-box">
  <h2>Example (very simple)</h2>
  <p>
    You may write your list like this:
  </p>

  <pre>
Juan Dela Cruz – Father – Deceased
Maria Dela Cruz – Mother – Living
Ana Dela Cruz – Daughter – Living
  </pre>

  <p class="mini-note">
    This does not need to be perfect.
    It only helps us understand the structure.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="soft-box">
  <h2>If relationships feel complicated</h2>
  <p>
    You may describe relationships in your own words, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>“First marriage”</li>
    <li>“Second partner”</li>
    <li>“Adopted child”</li>
    <li>“Raised by grandparents”</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mini-note">
    You do not need to explain everything here.
    Detailed or sensitive notes will be handled in the next step.
