  <!-- Getting Started -->
  <section class="tt-block">
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Start with What You Know</h3>
    <p>
      You don’t need complete information to begin.
      Names, basic relationships, and partial details are enough.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Build Real Relationships</h3>
    <p>
      TinyTeam supports real-life structures — blended families,
      multiple parents, extended relatives, and evolving communities.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Honor Loved Ones</h3>
    <p>
      You may mark loved ones who have passed away using
      an <em>In Loving Memory</em> designation.
      Their place remains visible and respected.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Grow Over Time</h3>
    <p>
      Your library is not meant to be finished in one sitting.
      You can return anytime to add more people, stories, or updates.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5: Decide on Output Later</h3>
    <p>
      Your library can remain cloud-based or be prepared later
      for printing (A5, A4, A3, or book formats).
      You don’t need to decide now.
