    <h2>How to Prepare While You Wait</h2>

    <h3>1. Gather Information</h3>
    <p>
      Names, relationships, and any details you already know are enough to begin.
      You can always update later.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Think About Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Decide how you’d like your library organized — by family, clan,
      community, or organization.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Decide on Output (Optional)</h3>
    <p>
      Your library can stay cloud-based or be printed later (A5, A4, A3, or book).
      You don’t need to decide now.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Optional: Legacy Pages</h3>
    <p>
      You’ll have the option to add Legacy Pages for aspirations, stories,
      and tributes — now or later.
