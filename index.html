          <h2>What Is TinyTeam Digital Library?</h2>
          <p>
            TinyTeam is a digital library designed to help families, communities,
            and organizations organize people and relationships in a way that feels
            respectful, flexible, and future-ready.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not just a place to store information — it’s a space where
            connections, histories, and stories can live together and evolve over time.

            What begins as simple information can become something meaningful —
            a family hierarchy, a clan record, a community directory, or a printed book
            that future generations can hold, read, and understand.
