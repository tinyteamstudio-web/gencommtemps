    <!-- What TinyTeam Is -->

      <h2>What Is TinyTeam Digital Library?</h2>
      <p>
        TinyTeam is a digital library designed to help families, communities,
        and organizations organize people and relationships in a way that feels
        respectful, flexible, and future-ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not just a place to store information — it’s a space where
        connections, histories, and stories can live together and evolve over time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- What It Becomes -->
    <section class="tt-section tt-soft">
      <h2>From Living Data to Lasting Memorabilia</h2>
      <p>
        What begins as simple information can become something meaningful —
        a family hierarchy, a clan record, a community directory, or a printed book
        that future generations can hold, read, and understand.
      </p>
