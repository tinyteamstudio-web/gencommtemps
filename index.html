  <p class="tt-faq-intro">
    Real answers for real families, communities, and organizations.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary>What if a person has different mothers or fathers?</summary>
    <p>
      TinyTeam supports real-life family structures. A person can be connected
      through multiple parental or guardian relationships. Nothing is forced
      into a single pattern.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Are blended families, step-parents, or adopted children supported?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Relationships are defined by connection, not labels. You decide how
      people are linked and described.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do we mark loved ones who have passed away?</summary>
    <p>
      You may gently mark a person as <em>In Loving Memory</em>. Their place in
      the family or community remains visible, respected, and intact.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why are packages based on the number of people?</summary>
    <p>
      All packages include the same features. Capacity simply ensures the
      system stays organized and comfortable as your family or community grows.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What happens if we exceed our package limit?</summary>
    <p>
      Nothing is deleted. You can upgrade or add capacity anytime. Your data
      remains safe.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why is this better than documents or folders?</summary>
    <p>
      Documents store information. TinyTeam preserves relationships, structure,
      and meaning — something folders can’t show.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What are Legacy Pages?</summary>
    <p>
      Legacy Pages let you write aspirations, stories, and tributes, and attach
      photos or memorabilia. They can stay separate or be merged later into your
      main library.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>If we print a hardbound version, is formatting automatic?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Page layout, margins, and binding rules are handled automatically so
      you don’t need to worry about technical details.
